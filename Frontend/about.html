  <h2>About Buy Me a Chai</h2>
  <p>
    Buy Me a Chai is more than just a platform—it’s a community where creativity
    meets support. Here, every small gesture matters. Whether you're an artist,
    writer, musician, or creator of any kind, your work can inspire others, and
    even a single chai can fuel the next big idea.

    We believe that creators thrive when they feel appreciated. With Buy Me a Chai,
    supporters become part of a creator’s journey, helping them grow, experiment,
    and keep sharing their passion with the world. Small acts, big impact—one chai
    at a time.
